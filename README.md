# PHP MVC Framework
### Build a PHP MVC Framework From Scratch
Understand how MVC frameworks work, making it easier to learn an existing framework like Laravel or CodeIgniter. Also, use the Composer tool to manage third-party package dependencies and autoloading.

This contains a micro php mvc framework that:

 - Code organised into Models, Views and Controllers
 - Advanced router
 - Classes in namespaces with autoloading
 - Controllers with action filters
 - Views including a template engine
 - Models with resource-friendly database connectivity
 - Environment-specific configuration and error handling
